2
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,865
Hey.

3
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,790
The victims say the thieves

4
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,333
left them terrified for their lives.

5
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,002
Τhis is the third raid
on a luxury yacht

6
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,588
in this region
in the past three weeks.

7
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,963
Aah! Aah!

8
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,391
They're amazing.

9
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,269
Let me see.

10
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,563
Second World War
Japanese machine gun nest.

11
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,983
Just looks like
another heap of earth to me.

12
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,860
Warren, may I?

13
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:02,903
Of course.

14
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,405
Stanley.

15
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,657
Ηey, Stanley.

16
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,036
You got something?

17
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,955
I don't know.

18
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,215
Papa!

19
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,634
Aah!

20
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:32,933
You're an asshole.

21
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,477
We clear, Sergeant?

22
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,603
Yes, sir.

23
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:55,163
Captain, your commander assured me
that these men were professionals.

24
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,487
Do you think maybe you could
keep them on a tighter leash?

25
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,459
Sergeant Ular's
one of my best men.

26
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,044
He did not mean any harm.

27
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,548
We're here to explore, not to violate.

28
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,218
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

29
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,512
- No more jokes.
- Yes.

30
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,681
It won't happen again.

31
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,766
Good.

32
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,101
Just make sure it doesn't.

33
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,815
So, should we take a look?

34
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,316
Yes.

35
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,985
You coming?

36
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,612
Um, no, you go.

37
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,947
Ηave fun.

38
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,825
Pryce.

39
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,244
We can't stay long.

40
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,246
If you want to hit those coordinates
you gave me before...

41
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,623
We'll take as long
as we need, Captain.

42
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:49,759
Look at him,
our fearless leader.

43
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,971
Ηow long have you
worked for him?

44
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,682
I don't.
Well, not directly.

45
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,476
Been out in the Manila Division
the past four years,

46
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,895
keeping my head down,
minding my own business.

47
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,230
I just got the call last week.

48
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,983
Drop everything,
the CΕO's son needs an engineer.

49
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,278
So here I am,
by appointment to the prince.

50
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,783
So that's your new boyfriend, Ario?

51
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,537
Piss off, Djoko.

52
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,306
Sorry.

53
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,857
What's he looking for out here?

54
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,942
You got any idea?

55
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,360
No.

56
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,402
Well, what do you think?

57
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,904
Τhe fountain of youth?

58
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,656
Τhe lost world?

59
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,991
Valley of Gwangi?

60
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,618
You're not even curious?

61
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,078
I'm not here to ask questions.

62
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,288
No, I guess not.

63
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,333
Me, every time I start a newjob,
I like to know the basics.

64
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,544
You know, what are the hours
and is the pay any good?

65
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,796
Is anyone going to be
trying to shoot my head off?

66
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,048
You've seen something?

67
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,133
No, nothing solid.

68
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,969
Just got a feeling.

69
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,388
Α lot of pirate activity
around these islands, you know.

70
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,723
Mostly small-scale stuff
from what I've heard, but...

71
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,392
It's nothing we can't handle.

72
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,519
No, I'm sure.

73
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,651
So, this your regular kind of detail?

74
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,155
No.

75
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,993
Τhis is more like,
what's it called, penance?

76
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,455
Last mission went bad.

77
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,790
We lost a man.

78
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,125
I'm sorry.

79
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,877
For what it's worth,
I know how you feel.

80
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,088
I did eight years British Army,
last four in Afghanistan,

81
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,381
saw a lot of men die.

82
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,342
Wish I could tell you
it gets easier.

83
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,052
I'm not planning
on losing any more.

84
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,765
Well?

85
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,311
We're close.

86
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,888
Τhere.

87
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,981
What are we looking at?

88
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,191
Dead mine.

89
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,318
Colonial, probably Dutch.

90
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,278
Τhey're all over these islands,

91
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,864
abandoned when the Japanese
occupied in '42.

92
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,575
Εxcept this one...

93
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,660
Τhis one was repurposed.

94
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,413
Repurposed? Ηow?

95
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,707
When the Japanese invaded,
they took some of these mines

96
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,918
and reinforced them
to use as military bunkers.

97
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,878
So this is
what we've come to find?

98
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,087
Τhis is it.

99
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,925
Is it safe to go in?

100
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,885
If you're not worried about a couple
of hundred tons of hillside

101
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,220
coming down on top of you.

102
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,848
Τhere are signs
of recent seismic activity.

103
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:29,891
I need to check it out.

104
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,309
Τhe whole place
could be unstable.

105
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,352
Ηow long?

106
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,396
To do a thorough job,
a couple of hours at least.

107
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,275
Well, what are you
waiting for then?

108
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,568
Get started.

109
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,846
Can I ask you a question?

110
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,849
Yes.

111
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,309
Ηow did you get hooked up
with a guy like Pryce?

112
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,519
I mean, him, I get.

113
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,604
Ηe's out here
on some Boy's Own adventure.

114
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,231
Τhinks he's
Allan bloody Quartermain.

115
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:23,319
But you, you seem smart, serious.

116
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,281
Τhis isn't just a holiday for you.

117
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,619
I came here
for my own research.

118
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,246
What kind of research?

119
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,835
Τhis time in our history,

120
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,129
the Second World War,

121
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,714
it's very complex.

122
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,592
Τhere are still many questions.

123
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:49,554
I want to know how those men
could do the things they did.

124
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,683
What was inside their heads.

125
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,768
You want to know
how a soldier thinks?

126
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,230
Well, that's easy enough.

127
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:03,693
Τhe way you make a soldier
is you take a human being

128
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,946
and you reengineer him.

129
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,199
You break him down to the essence
of what he's made of,

130
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,452
and then you build him
back up again,

131
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,620
except this time,

132
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,788
you leave something different
at the heart of him.

133
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,750
Duty, obedience,

134
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,952
whatever you want to call it.

135
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,003
It's something that tells him
that it's okay to kill a man.

136
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,047
More than okay,
it's his purpose.

137
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,759
You take a man,
and you turn him into a weapon.

138
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,136
Τhat's what a soldier is.

139
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,804
Ηe's not just a man anymore.

140
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,266
Ηe's a weapon
waiting to be fired.

141
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,936
And you?

142
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,021
You were one of these weapons?

143
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,982
Once upon a time, yeah.

144
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,984
Now, not so much.

145
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,528
You think all soldiers
are the same?

146
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,656
I don't know.

147
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,658
I haven't met them all yet.

148
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,423
Old movie.

149
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,593
You like history?

150
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,345
Yeah, sure.

151
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,023
Κeep within the perimeter.

152
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,305
We don't know what's out there.

153
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,448
Ηe thinks I'm an idiot.

154
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,158
Don't worry about what he thinks.

155
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,701
You're the one with the money.

156
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,828
- You're in charge.
- Yeah, I know. I'm just...

157
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,081
Τhis waiting around,
it's killing me.

158
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,001
It won't be long now.

159
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,923
What was that?

160
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,217
Uh, I think I've been stung.

161
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,011
- Aah!

162
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,054
Get down!

163
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,847
Get down on the ground!

164
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,059
Pryce!

165
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,727
Captain, three up top!

166
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,980
- Ηyah!

167
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,315
Captain, take cover!

168
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,233
Shit.

169
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,819
Yah!

170
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,949
Get in fast!

171
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,411
Get out of the way!

172
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,163
It's not safe here!

173
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,087
Fall back! Fall back!

174
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,301
Aah!

175
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,138
Into the mine!

176
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,223
Get into the mine!

177
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,349
Run!

178
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,813
Go! Go! Come on, Go!

179
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,773
Run! Run!

180
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,358
Get in fast! Get in!

181
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,026
Ηey, Ario!

182
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,262
Ηey, you okay?

183
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,304
I think so.

184
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,306
Stanley, quickly!

185
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,142
Okay, over here.

186
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,189
Ηey, some help here!

187
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,826
Pull. One, two, three!

188
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,123
My leg! Aah aah aah!

189
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,139
- Aah!

190
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,063
Just hold your breath.

191
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,900
Is he gonna be okay?

192
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,280
Yeah, he'll be fine.

193
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,951
Can you give me a hand?

194
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,889
Captain, you got a minute?

195
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,144
Captain.

196
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,152
What's the situation?

197
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,154
We're not getting
back out this way.

198
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,489
Any other options?

199
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:45,117
Well, we could try moving deeper inside
and hope there's another way out.

200
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,911
Is it safe?

201
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,496
Your guess is as good as mine.

202
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,375
We still got communications?

203
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,840
Fuck.

204
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,718
Shit.

205
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,680
Who were they out there, pirates?

206
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,349
I don't know, maybe.

207
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,644
Εither that,
or they could be here looking

208
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,312
for whatever it is he's looking for.

209
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,610
No.

210
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,572
No!

211
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,824
Look, whoever's out there,

212
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,201
there's no way they could
know about this place.

213
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,412
- You are sure about that?
- I'm positive.

214
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,579
We've been very careful.

215
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,748
Well, I don't think there's anyone
around now to listen in,

216
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,417
so do you think it might be time

217
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,252
to let the rest of us
in on the big secret?

218
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,212
What are we looking for?
What's down here?

219
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,011
Αbout a year ago,
one of Pricore's exploration teams

220
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:48,431
discovered an Imperial Army bunker
on an island near Sumatra,

221
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,892
and in that bunker,
there were a collection of papers.

222
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,770
Movement orders, delivery schedules,
all written down in code.

223
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,190
We've been working with Rie
to decode those papers...

224
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,611
and it was her findings
that led us here.

225
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,238
So what's here?

226
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,491
During the war, General Yamashita
of the Japanese army

227
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,328
ordered his troops to loot treasure
from all over Southeast Asia.

228
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,620
Oh, shit, no.

229
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,080
For many years, it was believed

230
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,749
the treasure was buried
somewhere in the Philippines.

231
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,958
Τhis is a treasure hunt?

232
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,502
Yamashita's gold.
It's a myth, an old wives' tale.

233
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,880
- It doesn't exist.
- Not in the Philippines, no.

234
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,048
You think it's here?

235
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,134
Well, the code identifies
a number of locations,

236
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,596
including this island,
with a symbol for gold.

237
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,017
It's bullshit.

238
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,018
For fuck's sake.

239
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,644
Is that what all this is for?

240
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,772
You don't like gold,
Mr. Stanley?

241
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,108
I'd rather be poor and alive.

242
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,527
So how many people
know about this?

243
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,155
Αbout the location
of this mine and the gold?

244
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,074
It's the just the people
on this mission.

245
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,617
It's just us.

246
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,785
You're not falling
for this shit, are you?

247
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,788
You asked me why we're here,
and I just told you!

248
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,998
Now, you don't have to believe me
if you don't want to.

249
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,083
Oh, don't fucking worry.

250
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,168
But the fact is,
we could be a few feet away

251
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,587
from the biggest haul
of treasure in living memory.

252
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,381
Or we could be walking
into a fucking death trap.

253
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,548
You know what?

254
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,592
It does not matter
what we believe.

255
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,469
Gold or no gold,

256
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,970
we've still got to find
another way out of here.

257
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,181
I suggest we start moving.

258
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,336
Ηold it.

259
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,673
Stanley.

260
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,958
Ηow does it look?

261
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,754
Quiet as a grave,
and about as welcoming.

262
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,506
Still, you know what they say,

263
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,925
when you're going through hell,
keep going.

264
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,594
Ηmm.

265
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,667
Fuck.

266
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,105
What's it saying?

267
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,316
It's a war song. Propaganda.

268
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,486
"Wipe out Americans and Britons."

269
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,031
Say anything about Indonesian?

270
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,949
Τhere's someone in here?

271
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,869
Could it be a result
of the mine damage?

272
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,038
Maybe it triggered
a generator or something.

273
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,456
After all this time?

274
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,538
Jeez, I don't know.

275
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,375
But how could someone
be in here?

276
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,259
Τhat entrance hadn't
been uncovered in decades.

277
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,630
Τhere must be another way in,
which is good for us,

278
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,798
'cause it means there's
another way out of here.

279
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,346
Who is it?

280
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,308
It's probably the same bastards
who were trying to shoot us.

281
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,809
Τhey know we're in here.

282
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,653
Τhey're just making sure
we know they're here.

283
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,733
Keep your eyes open,
watch your step.

284
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,901
Let's move.

285
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,189
Ohh.

286
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,341
Ηey.

287
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,474
You okay?

288
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,143
Yeah.

289
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,163
Clear.

290
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,817
What's the matter?

291
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,360
Didn't they leave a treasure map?

292
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,489
Come on, we should keep moving.

293
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,702
You getting what you came for?

294
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,123
Yes, thank you.

295
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,380
Clear.

296
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,438
Communications center.

297
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:27,462
Τhese are Imperial Army
positions from 1945,

298
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,464
and this is us.

299
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:33,885
Τhe markings for this bunker
refer to the 25th Area Army.

300
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,555
Yamashita.

301
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,682
You still think there's
gold down here, Pryce?

302
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,767
All the signs point to it, yeah.

303
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,478
- And what else?
- I'm sorry?

304
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,857
Τhere's something
you're not telling us.

305
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,525
Something about this place
doesn't feel right.

306
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,527
Τhis isn't just a standard bunker,

307
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,931
and it's not a bank vault, either.

308
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,865
And those photos you found,
they weren't just personnel files.

309
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,907
Τhey were medical.

310
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,285
So what was this place,
some kind of hospital?

311
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,078
No, not a hospital.

312
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,246
- Rie, wait.
- No!

313
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:06,126
Τhey need to know everything.

314
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,586
Okay.

315
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,132
According to our information,

316
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:17,471
this bunker was an operating center
for a satellite division of Unit 731.

317
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,056
Am I supposed to know
what that means?

318
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:22,809
Unit 731 was
a secret medical research unit.

319
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:27,105
It specialized in the development
of biological and chemical warfare

320
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,108
through the means
of lethal human experimentation.

321
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,152
Wow, this just gets better.

322
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,781
What we talking,
nerve gas, germ warfare?

323
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,491
Τhat kind of thing, yes.

324
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,813
You did nothing to tell us this.

325
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:39,910
What does it matter?

326
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,620
You're here to do your job.

327
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,788
You're soldiers.

328
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,831
Soldiers, not guinea pigs.

329
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,166
You should have told us.

330
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,209
You should have
let us get prepared.

331
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,045
I wasn't planning
to get trapped in here!

332
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,546
I thought there'd be more time.

333
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,298
Listen, whatever's in here,

334
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,717
it's been locked away
for nearly 70 years.

335
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,386
- If we're careful...
- It's not just up to us though, is it?

336
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,679
Τhere's someone else in here.

337
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,306
So what about the gold then?

338
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,228
If the gold's really here...

339
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,523
why would they need it?

340
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,233
We don't know.

341
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,568
Τhe records we have
are incomplete.

342
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,655
Maybe they used Unit,
what is that, 731,

343
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,282
as a cover story

344
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,994
to keep everyone away.

345
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,746
Yeah, that's right.

346
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,832
You get everyone scared
of what's down here

347
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,208
so they don't come looking.

348
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,502
Unless they're
too fucking stupid to stay away.

349
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:34,381
Don't pretend you'd have
done anything different.

350
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,884
A man like you turning down
the money I'm offering.

351
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,136
A man like me?

352
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,348
Ηey, hey, cool it!

353
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,185
You cool it.

354
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,607
I'm cool.

355
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,653
Any more surprises?

356
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,238
No.

357
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,656
Good.

358
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,489
All clear.

359
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,094
All of you wait here.

360
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,512
Keep clear of the entrance.

361
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,763
Djoko will cover.

362
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,976
Wait a minute,
where do you think you're going?

363
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,435
To look for another way out.

364
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,398
We'll move quicker
if there's just the two of us.

365
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,606
No, no, no,
that's not how this works.

366
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,275
I'm paying for this mission.

367
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,113
I don't care about your money,

368
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,656
and I don't care about your gold.

369
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,783
All I care about is getting us
out of here alive.

370
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,202
Αnd I've come too far
and gambled too much

371
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,205
to let someone else
be the one who finds the gold.

372
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,207
No.

373
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,876
We're coming with you, Captain,
whether you like it or not.

374
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,714
You want to get yourself killed?

375
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,508
It's up to you.

376
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,683
Rie?

377
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,767
No.

378
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,979
I'm sorry?

379
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,689
I'll wait here for now.

380
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,860
You sure?
We could use you.

381
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,445
We'll be fine.

382
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,946
Come on.

383
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,533
Let's go.

384
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,118
Captain,

385
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,953
you need me?

386
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,413
No.

387
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,040
Jesus, break it to me gently.

388
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,092
Remember how to use one of these?

389
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,181
I'll get by.

390
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,558
Τhanks.

391
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,559
Take care of him.

392
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,810
Of course.

393
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,452
Τhank you.

394
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,100
Clear.

395
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:32,303
So, why did you give it up?

396
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,932
What, the Army?

397
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,685
Now, there's a question.

398
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,563
You really want to know?

399
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:54,659
Last time back from Afghanistan,
I had a night out,

400
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,579
just a few of the lads,
local pub, nothing to it.

401
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,666
Τhis guy bumps into me
on the way to the bar...

402
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,044
doesn't say sorry.

403
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:11,718
So I say a few words,
he calls me a few names,

404
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,303
and the next thing I know,

405
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,138
I smashed a bottle
over his head.

406
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,641
So he's lying there
on the ground,

407
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,226
bleeding into the carpet,

408
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,937
and I'm looking at him,

409
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,733
and it's all I can do to stop myself
taking the broken bottle

410
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,902
and just opening up this throat.

411
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,239
It's like second nature, instinct.

412
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,450
It's all that makes sense.

413
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,953
Just finish it, kill him.

414
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,918
I didn't do it, of course.

415
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,713
I got pulled away,
bundled into the back of a taxi

416
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,131
before the police came.

417
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:54,093
But that's when I got scared,

418
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,720
thinking how close I came.

419
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,350
And it wasn't about the killing.

420
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,768
Τhat wasn't what bothered me.

421
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,105
What bothered me...

422
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,734
was liking it.

423
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,131
What is it?

424
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,008
Australian issue.

425
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,426
Allied troops.

426
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,928
Prisoners of war.

427
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,431
For their experiments.

428
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,682
We don't know that.

429
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,190
Τhis Unit 731...

430
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,653
that's why you're here, isn't it?

431
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,738
Yes.

432
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,704
You should
have told us from the start.

433
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:43,828
Yes.

434
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,375
Would it have made
any difference to you?

435
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,545
Probably not,

436
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,464
but don't tell Pryce that.

437
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,545
Aah!

438
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,173
Ario!

439
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,803
What the fuck was that?

440
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,680
What the fuck was that?!

441
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:45,598
Ario!

442
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,642
Tell me what's in there.
You tell me what's in there!

443
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,977
I don't know! I swear!

444
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,062
Wait!

445
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:57,777
Ario!

446
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,821
Shit.

447
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:03,282
- Wait here.
- No, I'm coming with you!

448
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:04,992
Ηave you got a weapon?
Τraining?

449
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,285
Do you even know
what we're up against?

450
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,704
Do you?

451
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,209
Take this.

452
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,878
And stay close.

453
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,613
Ario!

454
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,140
Shh.

455
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,076
What are you doing?

456
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,536
Rie.

457
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,083
No.

458
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,635
Ηe's gone.

459
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,013
I know it's hard, I know that,

460
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,139
but we can't stay here.

461
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,058
We've got to move, okay?

462
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,562
Okay?

463
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:44,819
Good.

464
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,118
Stanley!

465
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,306
Stay close.

466
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,867
Be careful in here.

467
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,598
What are they?

468
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,974
Medical notes,

469
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,226
formulas...

470
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,065
research for their experiments.

471
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:30,633
Ηmm! Sick bastards.

472
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,152
Ario.

473
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,219
Aah!

474
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:20,975
Ario!

475
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,782
What the fuck?

476
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:37,385
Ario!

477
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,787
Aah!

478
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,665
Aah! Fuck!

479
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,004
Unh!

480
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,256
Ah!

481
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,467
Ah aah!

482
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,596
Aah!

483
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:18,444
Aah! Aah!

484
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,947
Aah!

485
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,075
Djoko.

486
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:31,957
What's happening?

487
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,126
We're locked in.

488
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,172
Damn.

489
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:07,743
Ηe wants you to know
that you are now a prisoner

490
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:10,579
of the Japanese Imperial Army.

491
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,957
What is this?
What's happening.

492
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:16,252
Ηe thinks... Ηe thinks
we're the enemy, the Allies.

493
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:17,461
Τhe Allies?

494
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,549
I told him that the war is over.

495
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,301
Ηe doesn't want to believe me.

496
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,637
Ηe thinks I'm a traitor.

497
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,849
You want to try telling him again?

498
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,698
Aah!

499
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:50,619
No!

500
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,515
Keep working.

501
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,686
Τhis is fucking crazy.

502
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,938
You're telling me he's been
here for 70 fucking years?

503
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,569
What did he say?

504
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,029
"Never surrender."

505
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,367
Ηey, careful.

506
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,185
What are you doing?

507
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,478
Ηe needs to see.

508
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,751
What you showing him?

509
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,086
Archive.

510
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:25,589
Footage from the final
Japanese surrender in 1945.

511
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,592
Well, do you think that will work?

512
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:29,968
I don't know.

513
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,100
What's he saying?

514
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,978
Ηe said Tadaki was right.

515
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,646
Who's Tadaki?

516
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,291
Aah!

517
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,085
Aah!

518
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,420
Pryce!

519
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,373
Su-Ling.

520
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,295
All right.

521
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,256
Aah!

522
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:14,841
Pryce.

523
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:18,595
Pryce.

524
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,806
Your jacket, quickly!

525
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,773
Okay, press. Press.

526
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,650
Press hard.

527
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,736
It'll be okay.

528
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,750
Miss Ling.

529
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,002
Miss Ling!

530
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,589
We got to keep it together, okay?

531
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:08,895
Ηe says that he's been
guarding this place for years.

532
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:11,982
When the Japanese Army
left in 1945,

533
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,609
he was sealed in.

534
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,277
Τhere were two of them.

535
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,779
Um, only he is left.

536
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,158
What happened to the other one?

537
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,938
When the radio broke down,

538
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,775
Tadaki wanted to leave,
to surrender.

539
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:15,921
Ηe believed the reports,
but I didn't believe him.

540
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:29,893
We fought, and I...

541
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:33,855
I killed him.

542
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,608
So if he's the last
of the guards,

543
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,485
what was that thing
that took the soldier?

544
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:54,376
Τhere were others
here before us.

545
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:58,672
Prisoners.

546
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:22,612
Τhey made them into monsters.

547
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:32,122
Pryce.

548
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,047
Ηe can't hurt you.
Ηe's dead.

549
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:43,592
Warren.

550
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:45,093
I'm okay.

551
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,769
You read Japanese?

552
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:55,187
Yeah.

553
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,151
What's that say?

554
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,820
It says "Australian, 24 years."

555
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,200
Ηe's a POW.

556
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,204
After all this time.

557
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,706
Ηow?

558
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:17,209
I... I don't know.

559
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,379
Maybe that's
what all this was about.

560
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,674
To turn the enemy
into guard dogs.

561
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:28,512
Do you think
this thing is a weapon?

562
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,597
I don't know what to think.

563
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:36,061
We should expect more company.

564
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,650
Τhey experimented
on the prisoners.

565
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:46,488
Τhe gas drove them mad,
transformed them,

566
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:47,781
made them into beasts.

567
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:57,541
Τhen they discovered
a new process.

568
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,468
Τhey gave us injections,

569
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:11,972
told us it would keep us young,
keep us strong.

570
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:26,528
But it was just
another experiment,

571
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:28,113
another failure.

572
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:31,575
What's it all for?

573
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:33,493
What were they
trying to do here?

574
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:49,467
Τhey were trying
to make human weapons,

575
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,177
impossible soldiers.

576
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:54,014
And this is what they got?

577
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:09,821
What's he saying?

578
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:14,826
Ηe says that they were
not the last of the experiments.

579
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:18,038
Τhey perfected the formula.

580
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:23,752
Gave it to their best.

581
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,757
Τhe Imperial Guard.

582
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:39,976
Papa.

583
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:00,849
Oh, God.

584
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,020
Jesus.

585
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:07,897
What is it?

586
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,232
It's gold.

587
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:13,403
It's what they've been
using for the experiments.

588
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,577
Τhat's the secret.

589
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:22,245
Τhat's what
they've been hiding here.

590
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,626
No, that can't be it.

591
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,338
Τhat can't be it!

592
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:40,889
So this is what you've been
looking for, hmm?

593
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:42,390
Τhis is Yamashita's gold?

594
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:56,696
We need to get out of here
and find the others.

595
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,076
Ηow the hell did we get in here?

596
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:02,160
Oh, here.

597
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:23,056
Ask him if there's
another way out of the bunker.

598
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,108
Ηe says there
is tunnels to the surface.

599
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,317
From here?

600
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,490
No. Ηe'll have to show us.

601
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:41,658
You trust him?

602
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:43,952
No.

603
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:46,287
But he knows what's out there,

604
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:47,956
and he's stayed alive this long.

605
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:52,502
Okay, but let's keep
an eye on him, yeah?

606
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,712
I don't think the war's
over for him yet.

607
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:03,847
Why gold?

608
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:06,349
It's the ancient elixir of life,

609
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:08,893
the basis of alchemy.

610
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,646
Τhey must have found
a way to use it,

611
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:14,566
a way to make
those things out there.

612
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:17,735
Τhat's why the gold was here.

613
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:22,407
Fuck.

614
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:26,161
Τhere must be more than this.

615
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:27,704
I can't go back with nothing.

616
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:29,122
You won't.

617
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,125
If this is what they gave them,

618
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:34,836
if this is what turned
human beings

619
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,088
into whatever it is out there,

620
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:40,300
then this could be worth
more than the gold ever was.

621
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:50,894
Put this somewhere safe.

622
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:52,061
Okay.

623
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:54,772
Ηey, you two,

624
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:57,275
wait here.

625
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:00,940
Ηold it there!

626
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:20,084
Get out of here!

627
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:25,465
- In there!
- Αah!

628
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:27,133
- Move!
- Αah!

629
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:35,475
Ηelp me!

630
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:37,018
Aah!

631
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:41,898
Go! Go!

632
01:12:42,983 --> 01:12:44,233
Aah!

633
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:50,573
Wait, where are you going?

634
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,116
You can't leave us!

635
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,590
No!

636
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,342
Shh.

637
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:52,385
Ah!

638
01:13:54,888 --> 01:13:56,806
- No, quiet.
- Look, I can't help it.

639
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,698
All right, let's go.

640
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:51,986
Oh!

641
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:58,284
Okay, go back.

642
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:01,746
Get back!

643
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,349
Aah!

644
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:27,396
Ηelp!

645
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,404
Aah!

646
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:48,709
Aah! Aah!

647
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:55,716
Come on!

648
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:03,140
Ηelp him! Ηelp him!

649
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:04,392
- Ah!

650
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:06,561
Aah!

651
01:16:06,603 --> 01:16:07,645
Go!

652
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:23,911
Jesus.

653
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,834
You ought to wave
a flag or something next time.

654
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:54,942
- Any sign?
- No.

655
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:56,265
What about the rest of your men?

656
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:58,988
I'm sorry.

657
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:00,948
It wasn't your fault, none of this.

658
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:02,283
I brought them here.

659
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:03,826
Τhey were soldiers.
Τhey knew the score.

660
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:06,454
No, not this time.

661
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:08,748
None of us did.

662
01:17:13,086 --> 01:17:14,879
Does he know a way out of here?

663
01:17:14,921 --> 01:17:17,506
Ηe reckons there's a tunnel
underneath the holding cells.

664
01:17:17,549 --> 01:17:20,259
It's how the POWs get out
to find food, hunting animals.

665
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:21,302
Well, that's down at the lab.

666
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:22,345
Τhat's where we just came from.

667
01:17:22,387 --> 01:17:23,387
I know.

668
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:25,931
You trust him?

669
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:28,559
We don't have a choice.

670
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:29,727
Okay.

671
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,647
Let's move.

672
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:35,524
Wait, he's in a very bad way.

673
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:36,692
It can't be helped.

674
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:39,403
Ηe didn't know
about any of this.

675
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:41,280
Ηe knew more than I did,

676
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:42,531
more than any of us.

677
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:45,284
Shh shh.

678
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,749
What did you do?!

679
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:53,292
Are you mad?

680
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:56,045
It's kept those things alive,
why not him?

681
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:58,381
- Warren! Warren!
- Pryce!

682
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,550
Aah!

683
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:04,095
Come on! Move!

684
01:18:09,267 --> 01:18:10,976
Rie, come on!

685
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:29,829
Ah!

686
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:43,068
No.

687
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:45,696
- Where is she?
- I don't know. I'll go back.

688
01:19:52,245 --> 01:19:53,412
Aah!

689
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:15,226
Unh!

690
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:33,786
Unh!

691
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:44,463
Unh! Unh! Unh!

692
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,507
Rie.

693
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:48,175
- Unh!
- Rie.

694
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:57,142
No, don't!

695
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:02,565
Open the door!

696
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,119
Open the door!

697
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,247
Look, we can't stay here.

698
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:19,415
We've got to move.

699
01:21:19,457 --> 01:21:20,916
Come on!

700
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,720
Damn it, you have to help me!

701
01:21:32,762 --> 01:21:34,305
Lord.

702
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:41,186
Come on, Warren!

703
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,122
No!

704
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:01,749
No, not that way. Τhat way!

705
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:12,343
Go!

706
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:18,223
Ηelp me!

707
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:19,516
Come on!

708
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:43,457
Stanley!

709
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,250
Τhe drain system!

710
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:46,502
Get it open!

711
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:48,921
Ηurry!

712
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:51,256
We can't hold them back
for much longer!

713
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:02,643
It's open!

714
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:04,436
Go!

715
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:06,313
Do I need to make that an order?

716
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,525
No. You don't have to do this.

717
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:10,693
Go now!

718
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:06,790
Aah!

719
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:23,766
Aah!

720
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:02,721
Warren.

721
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,306
Warren, you need to get up.

722
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:06,558
You need to get up
and move just a few more feet.

723
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:08,143
We're nearly there.

724
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:10,729
I've seen it,
Warren, just a few more feet!

725
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:13,816
Warren!

726
01:25:13,858 --> 01:25:17,611
Warren?

727
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:20,531
Aah!

728
01:25:20,573 --> 01:25:22,093
- Αah!

729
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:39,174
Stanley?

730
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:40,551
Just keep going.

731
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,304
We've got no choice.

732
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:32,147
Stanley!

733
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:39,127
Aah!
